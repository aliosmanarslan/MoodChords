## Getting Started

Mood Chords use HUAWEI services. In order to use them, you have to [create an app](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/distribution/app/agc-create_app) first. Before getting started, please [sign-up](https://id1.cloud.huawei.com/CAS/portal/userRegister/regbyemail.html?service=https%3A%2F%2Foauth-login1.cloud.huawei.com%2Foauth2%2Fv2%2Flogin%3Faccess_type%3Doffline%26client_id%3D6099200%26display%3Dpage%26flowID%3D6d751ab7-28c0-403c-a7a8-6fc07681a45d%26h%3D1603370512.3540%26lang%3Den-us%26redirect_uri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fdeveloper.huawei.com%252Fconsumer%252Fen%252Flogin%252Fhtml%252FhandleLogin.html%26response_type%3Dcode%26scope%3Dopenid%2Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.huawei.com%252Fauth%252Faccount%252Fcountry%2Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.huawei.com%252Fauth%252Faccount%252Fbase.profile%26v%3D9f7b3af3ae56ae58c5cb23a5c1ff5af7d91720cea9a897be58cff23593e8c1ed&loginUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fid1.cloud.huawei.com%3A443%2FCAS%2Fportal%2FloginAuth.html&clientID=6099200&lang=en-us&display=page&loginChannel=89000060&reqClientType=89) for a HUAWEI developer account.

After creating the application, you need to [generate a signing certificate fingerprint](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/codelab/HMSPreparation/index.html#3). Then you have to set this fingerprint to the application you created in AppGallery Connect.
- Go to "My Projects" in AppGallery Connect.
- Find your project from the project list and click the app on the project card.
- On the Project Setting page, set SHA-256 certificate fingerprint to the SHA-256 fingerprint you've generated.
![AGC-Fingerprint](https://communityfile-drcn.op.hicloud.com/FileServer/getFile/cmtyPub/011/111/111/0000000000011111111.20200511174103.08977471998788006824067329965155:50510612082412:2800:6930AD86F3F5AF6B2740EF666A56165E65A37E64FA305A30C5EFB998DA38D409.png?needInitFileName=true?needInitFileName=true?needInitFileName=true?needInitFileName=true)

## Using the Application

- Before you run the app, make sure that you have a working internet connection since the application uses Huawei Mobile Services. Otherwise, the app will display a "no connection" screen until you turn the internet on.

After onboarding, the app continues to Login Screen to retrieve the information (username and profile picture) from Huawei Account (For this sign-in scenario, [Huawei Account Kit](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/hms/huawei-accountkit) is used).

Once you sign-in, you will be redirected to home screen where you can see your profile picture and username which retrieved from Huawei Account kit, your weekly mood, search bar where you can search your all chords, favorite songs list which shows favorite songs and camera usage to take selfie which needed for face catch and mood analyzing. 
By clicking one of favorite song list item, app will redirected user to chord screen where user can see clicked song lyrics with chords.
On the top right of the main screen, you'll find a profile icon. You can tap this icon to open profile screen. You can change your profile photo by clicking retrieved profile picture, change your username by clicking retrieved username, switch language of the app and sign-out.
